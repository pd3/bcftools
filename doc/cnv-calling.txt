Copy Number Variation
---------------------

The BCFtools package implements two methods (the ``polysomy`` and ``cnv``
commands) for sensitive detection of copy number alterations, aneuploidy and
contamination.
In contrast to other methods designed for identifying copy
number variations in a single sample or in a sample composed of a mixture of
normal and tumor cells, this method is tailored for determining differences
between two cell lines, which allows to distinguish between normal and novel
copy number variation. 
Although the method was developed for use with genome-wide SNP genotyping data,
it can be used also for high-coverage whole-genome or exome sequencing data.

=== Installation

For the ``polysomy`` command, the http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/[GNU Scientific Library]
must installed. The ``cnv`` command does not have external dependencies.
As described in the link:howtos/install.html[installation], 
the ``polysomy`` command must be compiled with ``USE_GPL=1``.
If it is still not visible in the list of commands, recompile with:

----
make USE_GPL=1 clean all
----

Now typing ``bcftools polysomy`` should give you a list of available options.


=== Preparing input data

The ``polysomy`` command takes on input VCF with FORMAT columns annotated with
B-Allele Frequency (the BAF annotation). The ``cnv`` command in addition requires the presence of
Log R Ratio values (the LRR annotation). If the experimental data were prepared
by Illumina's GenomeStudio, its text output can be converted to VCF using the 
https://github.com/VertebrateResequencing/vr-codebase/blob/develop/scripts/fcr-to-vcf[fcr-to-vcf] script.

----
# First we need to create a mapping between SNP names and genomic coordinates
# and convert alleles from Illumina's TOP/BOT strand convention to the reference
# coordinates, forward strand.
#
# The file with SNP definitions looks like this:
#
$ head -2 HumanOmni.csv
Index,Name,Chromosome,Position,GenTrain Score,SNP,ILMN Strand,Customer Strand,NormID
1,200610-1,MT,2755,0.762200,[A/G],TOP,BOT,13
2,200610-10,0,0,0.613600,[A/G],TOP,BOT,13

# And the input data file looks like this:
$ head -3 data.fcr
SNP Name        Sample ID       Allele1 - Top   Allele2 - Top   Theta   R       X       Y       X Raw   Y Raw   B Allele Freq   Log R Ratio
200610-1        A01_1   A       A       0.048   2.877   2.673   0.203   24228   878     0.0000  -0.2883
200610-10       A01_1   A       A       0.052   3.525   3.260   0.265   29549   1140    0.0000  -0.1750

# Let's create the mapping. This step needs to be done only once.
$ (head -1 HumanOmni.csv; tail -n +2 HumanOmni.csv | sort -t, -k3,3d -k4,4n ) | gzip -c > sorted.cvs.gz
$ zcat sorted.cvs.gz | ~/cvs/vr-codebase/scripts/fcr-to-vcf -M | bgzip -c > map.tab.gz

# Now convert the data into VCF
cat data.fcr | fcr-to-vcf -a map.tab.gz -o outdir/

=== Detecting aneuploidy and contamination

Large aberrations which affect whole chromosomes, such as aneuploidy or
contamination, can be discerned directly from the overall distribution of BAF
values. The command is
----
bcftools polysomy -v -o outdir/ file.vcf 
----
and the results can be found in ``outdir/dist.dat``. The file can be inspected visually or
processed by standard unix commands. For example, a list of chromosomes which are aberrant
or uncertain can be obtained by
----
cat outdir/dist.dat | awk '$1=="CN" && $3!=0'
----
If uncertain, it is very useful to inspect the BAF distribution by eye. The distribution
can be plotted using the auto-generated matplotlib script
----
python outdir/dist.py
----

The fitting may report a faillure printing -1 for the copy number state. This happens
when the the ``-f`` threshold is too strict or when  the experimental data are
too different from the expected distribution. In any case, seeing a large number of
non-diploid states indicates either noisy input data or a contamination.

the sample had three copies of chromosome X.

=== Detecting subchromosomal CNVs
The strength of the CNV caller is in the pairwise calling mode which detects
differences between two samples. This greatly helps to reduce the number of
false calls and also allows to distinguish between normal and novel copy number
variation. The command is
----
bcftools cnv -c sampleA -s sampleB -o outdir/ -p 0 file.vcf 
----
The ``-p 0`` option tells the program to automatically call matplotlib and
produce plots like the one in this example:

the control sample is normal and the query has two CNVs: duplication and loss.

=== Working with sequencing data 

If the above fails or in case of whole genome or exome sequence data, the VCFs can be annotated
"manually". We first call variants, estimate BAF values from the number of reference and
non-reference bases, and annotate the VCF. In this example, we are going to perform
pairwise CNV calling and we assume two samples in our BAM and VCF.

----
# Call variants. If using older versions, use samtools mpileup instead. The -t AD
# option fills the FORMAT/AD annotation.
$ bcftools mpileup -t AD -b file.bam -f ref.fa | bcftools call -mv -Ob -o calls.bcf

# Extract allelic frequencies, keeping only SNP sites where both samples made a call
# and where per-sample depth was at least dp=20.
dp=20
$ bcftools query calls.bcf -e'GT="." || TYPE="INDEL"' -f'%CHROM\t%POS[\t%AD{0}\t%AD{1}]\n' | \
    awk '{if($3+$4>'$dp' && $5+$6>'$dp') \
        printf "%s\t%s\t%.2f\t%.2f\n",$1,$2,1.0*$4/($3+$4),1.0*$6/($5+$6);}' | \
    bgzip -c > baf.txt.gz

# This is what the annotation file looks like
$ zcat baf.txt.gz | head -2
11  193096  0.24    0.16
11  193194  0.61    0.81

# Index the annotation file and fill in the BAF values. For the latter, we need to
# add a BAF definition into the VCF header
$ tabix -s1 -b2 -e2 baf.txt.gz
$ echo '##FORMAT=<ID=BAF,Number=1,Type=Float,Description="NGS estimate of BAF">' > baf.hdr
$ bcftools annotate -a baf.txt.gz -h baf.hdr -c CHROM,POS,FMT/BAF -Ob -o calls.baf.bcf calls.bcf
----

The B-Allele Frequency estimates from the exome data are much noisier, as shown
in this example: 

====
image::cnv-calling/bafdist.exome.trisomy.png[]
Example of BAF distribution obtained from exome data. Compare with the SNP array data
distribution in the example above.  The exome data included only sites with
more than 20x reads, only the RA (resp. RRA, RAA) peaks are shown.
====

While the ``polysomy`` command is unlikely to find a good fit of such data, the 
``cnv`` command can still do its magic. Because we have no LRR estimates, the program
must be told to ignore the LRR data by giving the ``-l 0`` option. Also the exome data is 
much more noisier, we set a higher BAF deviation via the ``-d`` option:
----
bcftools cnv -c Control -s Query -p 0 -o outdir/ -l0 -d 0.06,0.06
----
